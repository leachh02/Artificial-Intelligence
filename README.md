## Code:
Sokoban - A folder of Python files and images that are used to recreate the popular Sokoban game. Using search algorithms an AI has been developed to solve this.

MobileNetV2.py - A Python file that creates a machine-learning model with the use of a technique known as transfer learning. This model is able to classify flowers.

(Please note that some supplementary files included for the projects to run are not my own but rather the QUT organizations)
